Most of the river is easy single channel with a few corners, but there are a number of bedrock rapids which require class II and III skills to negotiate. The river is best with flows in the 20-50 cumecs flow range, but it is still a scenic float plus bony rapids run at 15-20 cumecs.</p><p>The put in can suit your timetable, but about 25km upriver the river is braided Class I and mostly of interest for bird watchers and fishers. The access is via the Molesworth road via Hanmer Springs and Jacks Pass and access details are available on DoC website. Generally you can get on this road between Christmas and early April, but kayakers can ask DoC Marlborough or DoC Waimakariri for access. The road is OK for cars with reasonable ground clearance.</p>"

If you haven't done the Anatoki you haven't done anything and if you go in prepared for anything - you will find it. If you are feeling lucky you could go without some food and overnight gear in your boat but most will want this as insurance - oh and don't expect any nice campsites if you do spend the night in there.<br />""A mix of mank and absolute classic drops but you have to work pretty hard for it all"" says Trent Garnham who managed a 2006 lightning fast run in 10hours with a very strong team! The Anatoki in good flow is just ten cumecs. The first 500m is flat and provides a chance for a warm up - yeah right!<br />The action comes at you for the next couple of hours in the form of some multiple drops and slides with small pools between. The section ends with a 5m waterfall and a small lake behind a slip. Just when you thought it was steep enough it gets steeper as the next 7km drops at 80m/km. This section is essentially a long and very steep rock garden and most things will need to be scouted.<br />Travelling at speeds of less than 1km/ hour is common but the portages are short and not difficult. Approximately two kilometres above Anatoki Bend are two nice, four metre waterfalls, the first can be portaged but the second is a clean drop into a big pool and can't be portaged. Shortly after this is a gravel beach which has okay camping for a multi day trip or provides a landing zone and starting point for a one day.<br />To get to the take out; from Takaka drive towards nelson for 2km. Turn right onto Anatoki Valley rd and drive approximately 5km, passing Bencarri Farm Park. Either park and fly from the old sawmill (you must ask the farmers permission to land the helicopter and cross his land) or further up the valley where the river meets the road before Happy Sam's Farm.</p>"

The Arahura rates as one of the great kayaking runs in the world. It has a wide range of runnable flow levels, great scenery, wild location and stunning whitewater. The Arahura is often described as one of the most 'fair' West Coast Rivers - what you see is what you get - there are very few nasties in disguise. It benchmarks good honest boating.<br />In 1986 Hugh Canard and two companions made what is thought to be the first kayak descent beginning near Olderog Creek. In 1993 Bruce Barnes investigated and ran Third Gorge. By the end of that season at least four other teams had sampled the delights and word began to spread. In 1984 Bruce and Mick et al flew in through Styx Saddle and paddled from the top of the river, adding a class III+ section that is good when there is a good flow in the river. Rafts even made the scene with the first descent by raft in 2002. In 2006 Dave Kwant and JJ added another chapter by flying to Harmen Hut and reported a funky 'gotta do it once' adventure in the upper Arahura Stream down to Styx Saddle and out in 6.5 hours with good water level!<br />From the normal put in busy class III-IV rock gardens lead into Third Gorge. Half a kilometre in is Curtain Call, one of the most photographed drops on the coast and worthy of all of them. Do what ever you do and smile for the camera(s). A couple of hundred metres further down is Dent Falls (the next most photographed drop on the coast). Scouting is easiest on the right side. Dent has been run any number of ways successfully, and unsuccessfully. Life stays busy for another half kilometre below Dent Falls before the intensity eases until Olderog Creek (there is a hut here).<br />Tight, class IV+ leads into Second Gorge and the technical crux of the Arahura. Billiards is a steep, punchy rapid with some testing hydraulics. Station a throw bagger next to them. Dave Mills lead the way in Billiards rescues on one trip by pulling two people (who were window shading in the hole) onto the rock, still in their boats, giving them the brief on the rest of the rapid before shoving them back in to finish off! This benevolent deed was unjustly rewarded in Jan 2005 when Dave swam at Billiards and went through a very long underwater sieve. There is an 'alternate route' down the left side and the 'alternate alternate' route on the far left. Another 200m of steep water and the gradient eases except for the one rapid everyone forgets - 'Alzheimer's'. Class I and II make up the 2-3km down to the Cesspit.<br />If you've already decided against the final gorge, the track is on river left about 150m before the gorge starts. If you miss this take out on river left above the 'pit' and thrash up the creek to the track. 15-20 minutes will see you back at the river for the final few kilometres of class II-III water to the take out. Expect a gradient of 36m/km in the first 5 kilometre easing to 21m/km.<br />Scouting the Cesspool entry is easy from the either side. There are a number of alternatives if choosing to paddle. The honest choice is to run down the middle and make the fine line across the turning curtain of water and open book corner.  Once landed hold onto your hat and avoid the hole (left) and cave (right) and the new rocks that have appeared. Or, drop in from the right over the rock ledge for the 3.5m boof (it's shallow in there so make sure to flat land), grovel around the tricky rock and do as the first option. Or, portage on the left side and seal launch into the big pool for the last class IV gorge with some fantastic moves.</p>"

Be wary of undercut rocks and the odd trapped log in this section. Eventually the two channels join and you will feel the extra water suddenly through a series of big water moves and hydraulics. These lead to a long flat section just above the crux rapid. Scout from the rocks at the head of the rapid. Portage on river right in the slippery moss and big boulders if you need to.  A tricky entrance and drop into a cauldron requires some thought, as does the important cauldron exit. The rest of the rapid has many big holes so hold on to your hat and poke "

Runnable only after reasonable rain, the creek affords numerous 1-2m drops and good class IV read and run.</p><p>It was first explored in 2003 by Trevor James, Andy Backhouse and Bob Cameron. It looked good but just needed the water. They didn't have to wait long - this is the west coast. Being fully aware of the potential for hidden logs and trees in this steep, treelined, corridor they treaded carefully and went in during low flows.  Over time the acceptable flow levels have raised so now it has been done in a wide range of flows. . Once on the main river you get a kilometre or so of class III+ to get warmed up. Things then steepen for 2.5km of mostly class IV/+ and there are a couple of ugly tree sieves that may require portaging and the crux rapid has a log railslide to boof then avoid a nasty cave with water pushing through it - you don't want to go into that! When things abruptly drop to class II it is all over and you just have to get to the bridge before you run out of water.</p><p><br />My first trip down was after a long drawn out day of waiting at the Blackball Hilton while a stationary front dumped over 160mm of rain in 24hours. At about 4.30pm we finally decided to go and hoped like crazy the level would drop quickly. At Smokeho Ck instead of a trickling current and crash and thrash to the river we had a miniature freight train ride to the confluence. The main creek was brown and charging as we picked our way very carefully down from (the few there were) eddy to eddy. We walked one tree sieve otherwise it was a great level to be in there. BUT - a swim was out of the question and good group boating skills were absolute necessary. In high water without prior knowledge it is solid class IV+ boating.<br /><br />To get to the take out: from Greymouth head north and cross the Cobden Bridge over the Grey River. Turn right and drive a short distance before a right turn again signposted to Taylorville and Blackball (along the Grey's true right bank). There is one more left turn (signposted Blackball) as the road heads back towards the Grey and Stillwater.  Keep on this, past the left turn for Blackball, and you will cross the Blackball Creek. Just bankfull and brown is a good flow. If it doesn't look like you can paddle/float down to the bridge it is probably too low and certainly will be by the time you get to the put in. Park on river left (there is another take out beyond the school which cuts out about 1.5km of the flat water at the end. You can find this for yourself).<br /><br />To get to the put-in: Drive back south to the signposted turnoff to Blackball. Drive up to Blackball and turn left at the Blackball Hilton. Follow this main street just out of town until the road splits and is sign posted "

It needs a northwest fresh or sustained southerly rain to be runnable (over 1.8m on the Te Marua gauge). Above 2.7m on this gauge it is a harder run (class IV) with plenty of holes and few eddies so you need to know where the holes are going to be.</p><p>At normal flows (2.0-2.5m) the Gorge is like a wilderness run even though it is close to Upper Hutt (and Wellington). After putting in on the Pakuratahi River next to the Regional Park car park (toilets) and smiling at the tourists who flock to the LOTR filming sites, there is a km of class II-III. Once you get to the last (flume) bridge it is time to make sure everryone is ""OK"" because walking out after this point is difficult. Logs are common in the Gorge and scouting of blind drops is mandatory unless you have prior recent knowledge. The logs shift in every flood so don't be tricked into thinking you know the river from six months ago.</p><p>After leaving the flume bridge the river flows around to the left where the first drop occurs. In 2007, this drop has no log in it and is really just a chute.  The easy but fast water and drops continue for 300m before the river goes left. This leads to the site of a recent (October 2007) pinning and overnight stay due to logs in the main flow. The offending logs have since been trimmed but have not yet moved so <em>this rapid is a mandatory scout and/or portage</em> depending on flows. Above 2.0m there is a line on the right or if you feel lazy you can go over the log. Below 2.0m portage is the only option. This rapid is now called Westpac in recognition of 2 recent chopper rescues. </p><p>Another 400m takes you through Anne's Drop (now small at normal flows) and down to the ""Weir"". This is a generally friendly river-wide log weir which is a great play spot for everyone. A great place to let off some steam and have a go.</p><p>The river then turns right down several chutes to a big pool which ends at the confluence of Putaputa Stream (enters on right) where there is a sharp left turn. The gradient steepens with a small drop then onto the rock gardens and after a right turn you enter the Chicayne Rapid. The usual line is left of the big rock in the middle. After this chute it's time to eddy out and do your best to scout the Log Drop. This is a riverwide rata log which lodged itself here about two years ago (2005?) and has created an extra degree of challenge for newbies on the Gorge. At low flow the best option is to portage on river right. At 2.0m it is not practical to portage and best to run it middle left. At high flows there is a car-eating hole on  river left so you need to keep right!</p><p>There is a big pool after the Log Drop then comes the Toilet Bowl - a steep tongue on river right is the easiest route or if you feel like a harder line go left.</p><p>From here is roughly 2km of easy class III with some play spots  which switch on and off depending on the flow.  In here is a nice class III drop called Pinball? which occurs on a left hand bend and is just above a play spot we used to call Woodies Wave?</p><p>Another 500m and you are at the half way point. The grade from here on is  easy class III but log danger can change this of course. After Kororipo Stream (enters right) the grade drops off even more until the last half hour or so is easy class II.</p><p>At flows above 2.1m the second half of the run is still good fun.</p><p>Take out when you get to the car park. There is a big pool where kayakers gather before running the next (learners) section called the Twin Lakes run.</p><p>The Hutt Gorge contains a variety of drops and waves. It is wisest to run it on a dropping river as the narrow gorge can fill up quickly and the grade can change appropriately. The scenery is awesome. Every time we take a new paddler down they can't believe  this is all so close to Wellington. But of course it is rain dependent so be prepared to sacrifice something to get to the Gorge!</p>"

Whatever the flow there always seems to be something to do.</p><p>After the put in the gorge closes in around you and an ominous roar heralds your arrival at the top of Smith's Falls. Find a wave, or if your life insurance is up-to-date catch a ride in the <em>big</em> hole on the right side. Beware of plummeting bungy jumpers off the second of the Twin Bridges.

The front wave is good at flows >300 but hard in short boats. A long stretch of canyon with excellent eddy lines leads into the final and crux rapid, Dog Leg. Out of control surfing in the first part of Dog Leg is not to be missed-but often is as the waves are fast and difficult to catch. Head left around the island and look for waves and a ledge hole on the left. The take out is on the right just beyond here and getting out here is a good idea as Nevis Bluff lies just a few kilometres downstream and there are no more take outs.</p><p>Camping at the take out is lovely, and there are some premium spots among the trees.

As a sure sign of the times and the speed of change in this sport Nevis used to be the pinnacle of NZ whitewater but has become a regular run for Queenstown locals and visiting hard people. It still continues to change and it is difficult to say whether it has become easier or not - it's still <em>big</em> and it's still impressive. Have fun and be safe.</p><p>Nevis Bluff came into existence when the Kawarau river carved its way around a particularly tough piece of bedrock. As people moved through the area early in the twentieth century the road was established and the bluff had to be dealt with. Blasting and road cutting saw huge amounts of rock tossed into the river creating the rapids we know and love as Nevis Bluff.</p><p>The rapids have a chequered history: in 1980 a young paddler from Nelson, Chris Moody, attempted the rapids in an old fibreglass kayak. This attempt might have been successful had his trusty old boat not broken up around him. He apparently swam the rapids and finished up with the cockpit coaming hanging like a hula hoop around his waist.<br />In the 1981 South Island Recreational River Survey, Graham Egarr noted: ""the rapids are unnavigable and exceedingly dangerous"". Then in 1983, US kayaking guru Rob Lessor made an attempt. Having seen the rapid and heard the rumours, he was dressed in two life jackets as he pushed into the current. He did, however, put in below the first drop, thus eliminating the first two moves. The rest of his run was successful.</p><p>In July 1984 the gates at the Kawarau Falls bridge were closed for an assessment of the recreational, visual, and environmental impacts of hydroelectric development involving lowering the Kawarau's flow. The flow was reported to be 40 cumecs (lower than any recorded natural flow). Greg Bell and Gordon Raynor paddled the whole rapid and Tony Marcinowski put in after the first drops. It is interesting to note that these paddlers, talented as they were, had chosen to prepare for the run in the fashion popular at the time which was probably attributable to their success:</p><p>	""Probably a kind of sixth sense telling me I was in a strange location bade me regain consciousness. A primeval survival instinct prevented me from yet opening my eyes. I was too frightened to move lest I disturbed the timpanist in my brain. My mouth felt like a small creature of the night had used it first as a latrine then as a mausoleum. Slowly, I opened my eyes; a big white thing stared down at me; I'd seen one before, but not from this angle. Over a bit further I spied a shower cabinet and some toothbrushes. Terrific - I had spent the night in the bathroom. Slowly, I arose and made my way to the lounge. I extricated my watch from a cup of cold tea - it was still early. The next thing I heard sounded very much like a bellowing hippo ""C'mon-let's go paddling""....."" - NZ Canoe, Rafting magazine No.31, 1984</p><p>"

After the slalom site the whirlpools spiral down the gorge through a number of unnamed rapids. The only one of note is halfway down the run - a large hydraulic named Man Eater. I have seen proof, however, that this hydraulic is non gender specific. Around 170 cumecs it can only be run hard right. Between 170-250 it is <em>huge</em> crashing wave and can be surfed if you have what it takes. From here down enjoy the scenery and the endless seams to bury your tail in.</p><p>Take some time to reflect that this slackening water which now runs into a lake once flowed on to the famous Sargood's Weir. Sargood's Weir was one of the biggest, best rapids in the country. There were not many solid class V <em>big</em> rapids (200-500 cumecs) in the world. We had one of them. It exuded power, technicality and lack of emotion. Paradoxically it demanded of its suitors awe, fear, but most of all respect. It remained unpaddled until 1980 when Mick Hopkinson, then on holiday from the UK, paddling a fibreglass slalom boat successfully ran the rapids. Rob Lessor from the USA claimed the second descent in 1983. Then in 1984 Mick Hopkinson with partner in crime, Dirk Passchier, returned again. Dirk claimed the first 'Kiwi' descent of Sargood's. Through the late 1980s it became 'the rapid' for any aspiring hardperson and saw a number of descents. The intensity of use increased when the plans were published which showed that the lake from the Clyde Dam was going to flood the area to immediately above Sargood's Weir. People were keen to paddle the rapid before it died. When it finally drowned a slow and lingering death in 1992, Mick, who had paddled the rapid eighteen times, mourned its passing like a lost friend - indeed it was.

It flows from north to south along the Main Divide, linking Mount Cook and Westland National Parks with Mt Aspiring National Park. Seen from the river, which for the most part runs through classic tussock and beech flats, dense silver beech forest blankets rugged gullies and ridges as far as the snow line.  Beyond, impressive ice cliffs and snow fields overspread numerous snow-capped peaks.<br />Flanked by mountains rising thousands of feet above the valley, the whitewater is challenging enough, given the Landsborough's remote and wild nature. At medium or low flows, most of the trip is Class III or easier, with a handful of more difficult rapids, all portageable.<br />The boundary of the Hooker-Landsborough Wilderness Area runs from McKerrow Creek, along the true right bank of the Landsborough, then up to the Solution range opposite Barron Ck at the beginning of Toe Toe Flat.  From Zora Creek the 'What The F**k Are We Doing Here' Gorge contains about six waterfall-type drops, all named by the first raft trip.  From Hinds Flat down, several Class III and IV rapids exist.<br />With access to the upper river restricted by the Hooker-Landsborough Wilderness Area, a good approach is to chopper from Clarke Bluff (G37 230864) and put down at Kea Flat, overnighting at Fraser Hut. From Kea flat it's Class II or III, with occasional surf spots and many straightforward chutes past boulder banks.  Fraser Hut is barely maintained, so bivvy bags or tents are recommended. Be careful about camping in the wide open fields around Fraser Hut - the locals regard it as a landing strip for hunting parties...<br />Most of the whitewater action is within the Upper Gates Gorge.  Things get interesting with Hunt's Hole, a Class IV double-drop with a river-wide hole.  This is followed by a long gentle left-hand curve with huge schist boulders at the bottom (The Squeeze, Class IV)  which can get very challenging in high flow.  The crux at most flows is Hellfire, Class V, a left turn with a series of rock sieves and a huge boulder midstream about 3/4 down.  A couple of grade III rapids remain, including a hard right turn called Surprise Corner, before the river eases to Harper Flat and out to the Clarke.  From the Clarke confluence near Strutt Bluff, it's about 45 minutes of flat paddling through braids to the Haast and SH6.<br />The amount of water dumped on this part of New Zealand is legendary.  In flood, the Landsborough becomes monstrous and epics have occurred in the past. Getting in and out of the Landsborough valley by anything other than a helicopter is a major exercise, so parties should be well equipped and experienced.  A favourable forecast is an absolute pre-requisite, and packing a mountain radio is a sensible precaution.  The regular high flows modify the riverbed, so always scout the major rapids.<br />A useful campsite before the trip is at Pleasant Flat, about 5km south from Clarke Bluff on SH6.  To avoid the flat paddle at the end groups with 4WD or rentals may be able to negotiate a track from the bridge over the Haast river to near Strutt Bluff.  The nearest pub is at Haast, where you can also visit the superb DoC visitor's centre.</p>"

It's an excellent place for hearing the latest gossip, but removes any feeling of wilderness this run would have without all the people.</p><p>The Mangahao is dammed twice in the Tararua Ranges and its flow is diverted to Arapeti Stream, then west to Mangaore Stream. The Whitewater Park below the Mangahao Power Station makes use of this water, but use of the main Mangahao River is limited to when King Country Energy releases water twice a year by agreement, or when heavy rain forces them to spill water.</p><p>Having survived the very tight and winding road to the put-in, find a park and catch up with old friends. If you want you can even charter a helicopter from the take out thus avoiding the heinous shuttle. Escape to the river, which starts as a single channel in a deep bush-lined valley. A few kilometres down is the first gorge with a couple of rapids in the easy class IV range. The crux rapid in the first gorge is a series of drops through a narrow section culminating in a final rapid with some fun hydraulics. A large tree wedged at the bottom provides the objective danger in the rapid. There are some good play spots in this section, but you'll have to join the queue.</p><p>Once clear of this gorge there is a long stretch of relaxing and enjoyable class II-III water with fabulous scenery. A few harder class III+ rapids shake you out of your reverie, including boulder gardens requiring active manoeuvering to stay out of trouble. Two or three may make it to IV-, depending on the flow.</p><p>Gradually these rapids give way to easier water and the hills lay back into pastoral land. The river becomes shallow, braided class I and II. The take out arrives just as you decide you really didn't want a flat water training session for the day. Often there are stalls set up selling hot dogs, beer and other essential post-river delights. One of the trickiest parts of this run is ensuring your shuttle driver knows how to get from the put in to the take out.</p><p>To get to the put-in: go to the small town of Shannon on SH7 south of Palmerston North. Follow the signs to Mangahao Power Station. Drive past the station and Whitewater Park up the gravel road which climbs over a saddle. It descends slightly to Tokomaru No 3 Reservoir, skirts this and climbs again twisting and turning like a slippery eel. Eleven kilometres from the power station you arrive at Mangahao Reservoir No 2 and the put-in.</p><p>To get to the take-out: head back to Palmerston North on SH7. Find any signs which point to Aokautere or Pahiatua Track. Follow this windy road over the Tawarua Ranges. As the road flattens onto the lowlands near Makomako, look for a junction and right turn to Marima. Once at Marima follow signs to Kopikopiko via Kopikopiko Road. This road turns to gravel a couple of kilometres out of Marima and stays this way to the bridge. The take-out is in a paddock on the river left just upstream of the bridge. Good luck.</p>"

While the Wairua is still flooding over its banks this little gem will have been up and returned to its normal flow. From the put-in the river is tends to be rather boney; if it isn't then the gorge section will be very interesting.<br />For the first 1.5 km the river contains boulder and gravel rapids with some 1 to 2 metre drops at the ends. Just as you're thinking to yourself, there is not enough water in this river, the banks close in, constricting the flow into a smaller bedrock channel for the next 2 km. This section contains the hardest rapids, becoming pool drop with a few longer class III rapids. It is quite confined in places but can be mostly boat scouted although a quick check down some of the longer shoots might improve safety and ease your nerves.</p><p>When the Waiokumurau stream comes in from the right you are through the hardest section. The gradient eases and the river widens again returning to the boulder  and gravel rapids but this time with greater volume. These rapids keep up the fun for the next 5.5 km down to the take out. When you leave your shuttle vehicle at the take-out take time to familiarise yourself with the surroundings as it might be easy to miss from the river.</p><p>To get to the put in: From Whangarei take SH14 to Mangatapere, here turn right towards Tetoki, follow this road through the village until you get to Twin Bridges. Here turn left just before the bridge and follow the road up the valley for a further 11 or 12 km. Leave a shuttle vehicle where the river leaves the road for the last time . Continue along this road until you get to a T junction at Waimatenui, turn right and follow it down hill to the bridge.

It is important that it stays this way.The river, like its many tributaries, has cut a very deep path through the ash layers that make up the local terra firma. These deep slot gorges provided railway builders with plenty of headaches by forcing the construction of large viaducts across their depths. Other streams in the vicinity offer interesting paddling in high flows. Of note is the <a href=""/nz/wanganui/makatote/sh4-to-upper-manganui-valley-bridge"">Makatote</a> which has a stunning class III+ run from the viaduct down to the Manganui-a-te-ao.The highest put-in on the Manganui-a-te-ao is the old Hoihenga Bridge. A track on river right leads down to a small beach. Once you push off you are into what is known, awesomely, as the Top Gorge. This is the crux of the Manganui experience and is excellent in flood levels. The rapids are a series of large waves and hydraulics. Now and then they crash into a wall at the bottom, but there is usually a good pool at the bottom of each rapid. At very high flood levels the rapids reach class IV.Below Myers bridge (a small footbridge which can be reached on the river right side if someone needs to leave the river) the river widens and the rapids ease to fun class II-III down to the bridge at Ruatiti Domain. A slalom race is held each year on the rapids at the domainn. Between Ruatiti and the bridge at Makakahi is mostly class II water with some long flat stretches. If you miss the bridge at Makakahi then you are stuck with the trip all the way down to the next road access at Pipiriki on the Wanganui River.To get to the Put-in: turn west of SH4 about 4km north of Raetihi township and follow signs to Ruatihi. At a road junction near the Orautoha school, the road splits and becomes Pukekaha Road and Ohura Road. Follow Pukekaha Road for about 3.5km to a fork. Take the left fork to the Hoihenga bridge, The last 100m down to the bridge is steep and slippery, so your average car is best left at the top of the final zigzag.Take-out: go back to the Orautoha School. Follow Ohura Road for just over four kilometers to the bridge at the Ruatiti domain.</p>"

Mostly it's no more than a trickle of<br />water linking a series of swimming holes in a stunning gorge. But - after a<br />decent nights rain the river turns into something resembling a half pipe for<br />kayakers.</p><p>From the Pyes Pa Rd put in, the river<br />starts out shallow and fast with a smooth flat bottom and a range of easy<br />waterfalls. One larger fall, about an hour from the put in, is normally<br />portaged. After this fall the gradient starts to pick up a little, the walls<br />close in,and the river starts to look like the Kaituna. Most rapids can be boat<br />scouted or easily from the bank but there are a couple of blind gorges which<br />offer no chance of scouting and care must be taken to avoid logs.</p><p>About 10km down the water volume increases<br />because of natural springs in the river. The water gushing from the rocks on<br />both sides is quite impressive and also allows this section of river to be run<br />year round. It is possible to gain access through Lempriere's farm. It will<br />cost about $40 per team to get a ride down the farm on the tractor and you must<br />call before arriving.</p><p>Just below the springs are the two biggest<br />falls on the river. The first is at the bottom of a steep rapid. In low flows<br />you may want to portage on the left, in higher flows it can be run on river<br />right. The second fall is 100m downstream. This is an exciting one because<br />there is no chance to scout or portage!! But a good boof off the right side<br />will see you safely in the eddy.. A few more small drops keep the interest up<br />until the gradient eases right off. After this keep an eye out for a large<br />water gauge on the left side of the river. The track is on the right side of<br />the river just opposite this and takes you 200m up through pine forest and onto<br />a farm and Maungarangi Rd. If you miss this you can paddle to the Kaituna<br />confluence, turn up it a short distance and get out at Long Ridge Park.</p><p>To get to the put in: from Rotorua head<br />around the lake through the small settlement of Ngongotaha. About 5km north of<br />the township is the turnoff to Tauranga on Pyes Pa Rd. Follow this road for<br />about 16km until it drops into a deep gorge - this is the Mangorewa.</p><p>To get to the take out: there are a couple<br />of options and it doesn't make much difference. Either take Te Matai Rd through<br />to Te Puke then head back south. Or go back to SH33 past the Kaituna River and<br />head north on this. You are looking for Maungarangi Rd off SH33 about 2km south<br />of Paengaroa. Once on this road go 900m down to Long Ridge park just before the<br />Kaituna River bridge.

A small, tight gorge, it needs more than normal flow, but thanks to the Otago flow phone system you won't have to waste time driving to the river to check it out.<br />Initially the gorge is narrow and water flat. The rapids begin after 3km. A diversion tunnel on the right after 5km heralds the beginning of the gorge proper. Between the beginning and end of the tailrace are a number of steep, technical class III-IV rapids. All are easily portaged on the tailrace. They continue 2km past the tailrace outflow. Two steep and technical class V rapids follow each other in quick succession, both with high objective danger from rock sieves and undercuts.<br />Optimal flows are between 15 and 50 cumecs; at over 50 cumecs the water is very turbulent and becomes solid class V. Below the gorge relents before issuing onto Central Otago farmland just after the Chatto Creek confluence. From here to Keddel Rd is a half hour of flat water. It is possible to take out at Chatto Creek and walk 4km along the old railway line to the Chatto Creek pub.</p><p>To get to the put-in; 1.5km south-west of the small settlement of Omakau on SH85 is a short gravel road to the Ophir bridge.

It is a beautiful area and the river trip no less. Camping at the lakes is stunning and I suggest taking mountain bikes for exploring further up the valley.<p>From the put-in at the lake it's a fantastic float alongside honey-dew beech forest and through clear pools where trout cruise beneath underwater ledges. The forest gives way to a short gorge as the rapids pick up, climaxing with three drops. Rumour has it that these can get to class IV in very high flows, but in anything other than a big flood they are class III. The rapids settle as the gorge eases and the river breaks into farmland down to the next short gorge under the Kiwi Burn swingbridge. This small section is used often for beginner teaching sessions and novice slalom races. Take out and walk up the track to the carpark.</p><p>To get to the put-in: turn off SH93 (between Lumsden and Te Anau) at signs to Mavora Lakes.  Twenty six kilometres of gravel road takes you to the lakes and camping areas.

It makes a great beginner/intermediate trip if a few of the harder rapids are walked. If the weather forecast is excellent and you have a hot date it makes an excellent over night adventure too. The Maruia drains the southern Spenser Range and wends north alongside SH65 between Springs Junction and Murchison. The Shenandoah Mountains rise up to form a barrier that swings the river away from the road. The river moves west then back east to rejoin SH65 a few kilometres above Maruia Falls.</p><p>The run begins as easy class II riffles for a few kilometres until well away from the road. The beech forest crowding down to the water's edge is stunning. This, combined with crystal clear water and an abundance of fish and game, means that the most common visitors to the area are hunters and anglers. The few harder rapids are in the steeper areas with big boulders in the river. The paddling here is very enjoyable, and at very high flows the large waves that are kicked up keep you guessing at what's over the lip right to the finish. Towards the end the river enters a short gorge typical of the region. Once clear of this a kilometre or so of class I water will see you at the take out and road.</p><p>To get to the put in: find Creightons Rd off SH65 about 18km north of Springs Junction. Drive 2km down this gravel road to the barn and gate at the end of the road. A small stream runs alongside the road just by the gate. Follow this stream 150m to its confluence with the Maruia. Make sure that any vehicles left at the put in are well off the roadway, and ensure all gates and fences are left as they are found. Access is via a paper road.</p><p>To get to the take out: the take out is on the northern side of Shenandoah Saddle on SH65. The easiest parking area is at Ruffe Creek, where the Maruia returns to the road. There are small tracks through the bush to the river.</p>"

Make sure you pack your elbow pads!! It is the best in the region and offers some of the sickest, consistent hard boating in the country.  There are so many drops and rapids on this wee gem that to even attempt to give a blow by blow account of each rapid would be ludicrous!</p><p>Don't be fooled by the mellow start. You get about 2.5 km or so of boogie water to warm up on and get the blood flowing before a manky rapid just above the obvious Slot Gorge which is a mandatory portage.  Portage on the left and jump in from the ledge.  Watch the jump, there are shallow rocks!</p><p>This is really the start of the Nevis River proper, a couple of rapids later  - the game is on.  The next 5km contain everything from ledge drops 2 - 10 m, long combination rapids and tight technical drops. Through this next section expect a lot of primo, boat scoutable stuff that you can pretty much bomb your way down eddy to eddy, though as per usual, check anything you cant see the bottom of. There is still some groveling to do but many many classic drops. Most of it goes apart from a couple of choked out boulder jumbles with easy portages.</p><p>Of note is one rapid called Double Drop with a fast lead in finishing with a sweet boof at the bottom. This rapid heralds the next section you are about to drop into. Be careful through here as it is sieve city.  Make sure you can always see your next eddy as one rapid starts leading into another through this steep section. When you arrive at another BIG obvious horizon line then you are getting through it. Here you will see the river literally drop away from underneath you at Lunch Rapid, a class VI teaser, there is a line and it has been run, but this bad boy definitely rates high on the chunky scale; a tricky lead in and super tight line all to a must make move to avoid landing on a big rock from way up high. Portage on the left and this is usually a good time to grab a rest and get yourself sorted for the final onslaught downstream.</p><p>Below the portage you have 700m or so of continued steep before a quiet wee stretch for 200m which leads into the last STEEP section. The river drops like a staircase through here and when you reach a set of long steep rapids, one finishing with a 15 footer (great photo op), you are through the worst of it. From here the gradient begins to ease though you still have lots to keep you on your toes. Once you pass under the Nevis Bungy bridge you are home free and the Kawarau soon appears. You may be able to take out right at the confluence on the left side of the Kawarau but sometimes the gate is locked and you have to paddle through Citroen to the take out there.</p><p>Having someone who knows the run will cut your time down a lot. Expect anything from four to ten hours depending on your team. If you have the skills and are feeling good then you won't be disappointed. <strong>Watch out for the sieves!"

The river eases to class II as far as the Taruarau confluence, with many campsites, and class I to the Whanawhana take out. Users beware that a southerly wind will slow you down considerably. Take extra clothing as the wind can be chilling, especially if any of your party has taken a few inadvertent dunkings. </p><p>To get to the PUT IN: from either the Taihape or Napier/Hastings side get onto the Taihape-Napier road. It is a long drive whichever side you come in. Kuripapango is about halfway between Napier and Taihape.

The river is wide, shallow and swift over a shelf-like bedrock bottom but starts to steepen and narrow as it goes over a couple of smallish drops. It stays pretty narrow after this (portaging and inspection is difficult and sometimes painful due to the dense vegetation and the gorge - however, inspection is pretty important in places).<br />Just after the last rapid I described, there was a logjam which we had to portage. Not too difficult. Not far below this, the river went into a very narrow channel (2m wide) which lasted about 200-300m. The rapid was relatively easy - maybe grade 3, but committing and with logjam potential - inspectable. Below here, there may have been another narrow rapid before widening briefly. Following this was another very long, narrow, fast hydroslide style rapid which, due to high banks and dense vegetation was not really portageable or scoutable - we took a risk and paddled it blind. As it happened, there were no logjams and it was a nice long narrow grade 3+ rollercoaster (perhaps 4 because of degree of commitment) rapid.

Take one reasonably accessible yet wild river flowing through a spectacular, deep gorge. Add several challenging drops and one extremely cool play hole. Attach a large catchment that causes the river to rise and fall dramatically in short periods of time. Put a lodge, hot showers, a big open fireplace and a bar at the take-out. Job's on.</p><p>The Rangitikei is a classic that has been paddled for years by scores of kayakers, though its early paddling history was filled with the carnage of fibreglass boats. The first explorer to the gorge was Cliff Barnett who, in 1953, attempted the run in an open canoe. It wasn't until the early 1960s that two men from Palmerston North entered the gorge in a home-made, stainless steel canoe. It took them two seasons to get right through! The first complete kayak descent was in May 1974 by Max Grant (of 'Max's Drop'), Peter Sutcliffe and Dennis Oppatt.</p><p>The first six kilometres on the river is an excellent class III warm up for the harder stuff to follow. Pop Up is a fun little play spot guaranteed for loops and cartwheels. The first real water is a short drop, called Storm, which runs through a small gorge and into a wall at the bottom. This is followed by more easy water through the very obvious Narrows to the Lunch Spot, named because it is in fact a lunch spot, not a rapid.</p><p>Technical and bony in low flows, still technical and pushy in high flows, the gorge rapids proper follow in quick succession. New Rapid is constantly changing and is well worth scouting because it hides a couple of nasty pin spots. Then come The Gates, Slip Rapid, Max's Drop, Dog Leg, Fulcrum, Etc, Foamy, Foo Fang Falls, See Thru, Picket, Rodeo, Rockslide, Waimarino, Cascade Creek, Toi Toi Creek and Slalom Rapid right outside the Lodge. Of these Fulcrum and Foamy offer the crux of the paddling. There is a compulsory test at the end of the run to check if you have all the names right and in the right order!</p><p>If it's your first time down you'll probably want to scout some rapids as the line is not always obvious. More experienced paddlers should be able to boat-scout everything. Check in with Brian and Nicola Megaw at River Valley Lodge before you go on the river. They have been running the Lodge and rafting the river since 1986 and are tuned into changes of rocks, trees and water levels in the river. This is not a good run to choose as your first class IV outing! Don't be misled by the average gradient. Most of the drop is in the last 1.5km.</p><p>Above 50cu the rapids become very pushy, and time to correct any mistakes is reduced markedly. The river has been run at very high levels (>50cu) and makes for a great expert trip.</p><p>The Megaws, Sages and River Valley Lodge staff are very hospitable. They will drive a shuttle if arranged in advance. This saves the hour-long return trip to pick up cars when you could be sitting outside the Lodge with a beer or two. The Lodge offers camping, accommodation, golf, food and the all important bar.</p><p>River levels are best obtained on-line at <a href=""http://horizons.govt.nz/"" title=""http://horizons.govt.nz/"">http://horizons.govt.nz/</a> and the conversions are done by the nice folks at River Valley <a href=""http://rivervalley.co.nz"" title=""http://rivervalley.co.nz"">http://rivervalley.co.nz</a> While it isn't updated daily, it changes whenever the flow changes.

Signs of this are apparent along the whole journey.</p><p>The late 1800s saw gold fever hit the Shotover region, or Molyneux as it was then known. Much early river diversion and tunnel digging was done at this time. Legends abound of the hardy souls who toiled through freezing winters waist deep in the frigid water searching for the elusive strike. Temperatures get so cold that in the winter there are some 'seeps' from the walls that have been visited by ice climbing enthusiasts from Queenstown.</p><p>Gold is still being extracted ounce by ounce from the river, but most capital return comes from the surface of the river these days. The Queenstown tourism machine works the river's scenery, whitewater and history mostly through rafting and jet boating. Horse riding, historic sightseeing, parapenting, mountain biking, scenic flights and a plethora of other activities complete the menu for visitors to the region. These bring in far more gold than the river could ever yield.</p><p>The main gorge carves through outcrops of schist, while fine mica gives the river its silty colour. This stuff is gritty, gets through everything and is hard on contact lenses. The water is very cold, even in summer, so it's wise to wear a winter set of gear on this river.</p><p>After waving 'auf wiedersehn', or 'sayonara', to the rafters at the Deep Creek put in, the water is class II for most of the gorge with fun play holes and awesome scenery.</p><p>The action is in the final 1.5km through a section of rapids called The Mother, which doesn't announce itself in any particular way. Watch for a narrowing in the gorge, the disappearing horizon line and a small fin of rock. This is Sharks Fin and it is a shadow of its former appearance due to river changes and the formation of a new rapid just downstream called Miners Revenge. Scouting through The Mother is easiest on the left with an obvious trail used by rafters. The rapids are difficult to differentiate but the rafting promo pamphlets (they must be true!) say they go in order of: Sharks Fin, Miners Revenge, Germans, Anvil, Toilet and Pinball. Then down to the Oxenbridge Tunnel or Mother-in Law.</p><p>The Oxenbridge Tunnel was chiselled, cut and blasted from solid rock by the Oxenbridge brothers in an attempt to redirect the river and expose whatever treasures may have lain in the riverbed. It was an idea that didn't work but paddlers now must contend with the brothers' legacy. Paddle into the black hole in the cliff. If you can't fit, the river is too high! (If this is your first time on the river ask the rafters if they are running the tunnel.) Once inside, aim for the white blob of light and brace on the right. Water boils up from the right wall and tends to push you into the undercut left wall. Keep your boat pointed straight. People have broached in this tunnel and swum out without their boats. Always keep in the back of your mind that the light at the end of the tunnel could be an oncoming train!</p><p>Upon exiting the tunnel you're on the runway to the Cascade, another artificial rapid. The only stipulation on this one is to stay upright. The rocks below water are sharp and will slice you and your gear very nicely.<br />The Mother-in-law option follows the natural bed of the river to the left of the tunnel. It has a sharp drop at the top that pushes hard into rocks downstream. Once clear of this drop it is all over.</p><p>To get to the take out from Queenstown: head to Arthur's Point via Gorge Rd. Immediately before crossing the Edith Cavell bridge turn left onto a gravel road. Follow this for 600m to the bottom of Cascade rapid.</p><p>To get the put in: head back across the bridge. Continue east for a couple of kilometres to the junction signposted: Coronet Peak, Skippers Canyon. Turn left and climb for 4km. Turn left at the next sign to Skippers Canyon. Turn left again onto the gravel road. This road is very rough and windy. Rental cars are not insured on this road--bad luck. After 9.5km of slow driving, allowing rafting vehicles to pass whenever they want, you will arrive at the Deep Creek put in.</p>"

As it is, the road adds a little spice to a day in the upper valley. Try to avoid rainy days as the road gets very slippery. Many have been stuck.<br />The great thing about this run are the numerous ledge-type reversals that provide excellent play spots for those wanting to flip-flop around for ever or just learn to sit in a hole. The river is deep in the gorge and has a great wilderness feel until you reach the Skippers Canyon Bridge and are bombarded by falling bungy jumpers.<br />If considering the section from Skippers Bridge to Deep Creek (class I), it is worth contacting the jet boat drivers at the Skippers Bridge. The drivers are in radio contact with each other and will let everyone know there are kayakers on the lower section. This will save the fright and possible trauma of meeting a high speed craft, much bigger than you, unawares.</p><p>Camping is great at the MacLeod's put in area.

It is a very small creek, and as your second day will likely be on the Waingaro you need water to hang around for the second day as well.</p><p>The best and, depending on flows, possibly only place to start is at the end of the braids down from Lake Stanley. You will have seen nothing of the rapids on the way in due to the tight gorge. However almost immediately the whitewater starts and it doesn't stop until at the Waingaro Forks Hut. The run is tight and quite steep boulder gardens. There are only small drops, but the rapids are steep and can be relatively long. It is a fun creek though and requires some technical boating in some parts. Portaging is generally not a problem.

After the river exits the gorge, you will pass under a farm bridge on Timihanga station before heading back into the wilderness.

A trip on this river has a real wilderness feel as it runs through native forest for almost its entire length. Towering limestone cliffs, some right out of the river, escort the river on its journey to the sea.</p><p>The Mangahoe/Tawarau trip needs some rain to be at its best. From the put in paddle 400 metres to the start of the first gorge. Get out where the fence meets the river on the left side and walk 10-15mins along the formed track (which goes the length of the run). Below the gorge there are two sieves that are easily portaged at river level. Between here and the Tawarau confluence are a series of small, fun ledge drops. The water doubles at the confluence and the scenery keeps getting better. Not far downstream from here is a good play hole which makes a great lunch spot.</p><p>From here the action picks up. The first rapid is a 100m long channel only 2m wide followed by a double drop with the first drop pushing hard into an undercut rock. Another narrow drop into a pool puts you right above Dagger Falls, a three metre drop with a sizeable hole. After Dagger falls is Bob's Fall's which has a powerful hole and is capable of recirculating swimmers and gear for some time but is easily portaged on river right. From here it is only a short paddle to the takeout where the river flows through a massive sieve. Walk down the farm track to the waiting shuttle driver at the end of Speedies road. If you decide to portage this rapid do so on the left and from the base of this rapid to the Marakopa confluence there is some class IV water.

Any helicopter costs in the Toaroha are reasonable as it is on the doorstep of the Hokitika operators. If you do fly in - the fun thing to do is get your boats dropped as high as you can then portage, ferry, and paddle your way upstream to the last waterfall drop out of Toaroha Canyon. This fun little huck is a blast and good for picture taking and a great little adventure trip to add to your investment in flying.</p><p>To get to the take out: from Hokitika follow signs to Kokatahi.

The main reason for a Waiatoto trip is to enjoy the unbelieveable wilderness of south Westland with a group of friends and enjoy it with some good food and wine. There is some fun whitewater too! Most trips start at the Bonar Flats. A short gorge between this point and the next flats - Donald Flats - contains some classic class III boulder hopping that adds hydro interest to the scenery. The river is easy and becomes braided in the section down to the Drake River confluence. </p><p>The crux of the Waiatoto whitewater comes in the next five or six kilometres to Ferny Flats. Most of the action is at the start of the gorge and is in the class IV range (harder with higher flows), with portaging options if necessary. Once clear of the gorge proper the river widens into long, pleasant class II-III bouldergardens. There may be some boulder chokes in this section if the water level is very low.  Be wary of tree hazards especially in the easy water.  In 1978 a huge rockslide fell into the source lake and sent a biblical sized wall of water, ice blocks and debris down the river, wiping out a number of huts and forging new channels through mature forest. The tree stumps date back to this event.</p><p>Many parties spend the night on the Axius Flats at the Te Naihi River confluence where the fishing is superb.

From here to the dam is much bigger, but less technical.</p><p>The Whakapapaiti is a faster, more technical run than its eastern cousing the <a href=""/nz/wanganui/whakapapanui/matariki-falls-to-whakapapa-dam"">Whakapapanui</a>. Speed, and the river's continuous difficulties, combine to add an extra point to the classification, hence class IV. At some points channel decisions have to be made - and quickly. Once at the confluence with the <a href=""/nz/wanganui/whakapapanui/matariki-falls-to-whakapapa-dam"">Whakapapanui</a> the speed eases but the volume increases, as does the size of the hydraulics. Have fun.</p><p>Whatever the flow at the Whakapapa Dam, the Whakapapaiti will have 40% of it - for example, if there are 50cu at the dam, the Whakakapapaiti will have roughly 20cu. So it needs slightly higher flows to make it worthwhile.</p><p>To get to the put in: find the Whakapapaiti bridge on SH47 just west of the SH48 turnoff to the Chateau. Scramble down the bank to the river. There is a parking area on the river left side of the bridge if you are leaving a vehicle.</p><p>To get to the take out: head east on SH47 for about 8km, look for a sign to Whakapapa Intake. Follow the road 8km to its end at the dam.</p><p>Catchment:<br />Egarr_Comments: numerous waterfalls<br />Egarr_Code: 046.01.01<br />Egarr_Vol: NI<br />Egarr_Page: 45<br />Egarr_Rec: 2<br />Egarr_Scen: 4<br />RUS_Code: 3091</p>"

Of these, the Whakapapanui is the easier, more spectacular and scenic of the two. Like most Central North Island rivers they are rain dependent because of their small catchment area. Below 20cu the rivers are very scratchy. But don't be put off. This area offers world class boating when rain is falling, and believe me it falls a lot. Above 50cu be prepared for a no-holds-barred rollercoaster with few places to decide that you don't want to be there!</p><p>The rapids come in quick succession and boat scouting is the only feasible method of inspection. Most require boulder dodging to get the right line to avoid the inevitable wall at the bottom. What you find at the start of the run is indicative of everything down to the confluence with the Whakapapaiti. If disaster strikes in the first few rapids, gullies provide ways of escape up onto farmland on the right side of the river.</p><p>At the confluence the river becomes wider with bigger and, at times, challenging hydraulics. One large square rock forms a particularly weir-like hole in which some have spent a good deal of penalty time. Once at the dam, take-out on the left and carry around it. Put in again and ferry across to the carpark.</p><p>To get to the put in: find the Whakapapnui River on SH47 (about 5-6km from the junction with SH48). Park about 600m west of the actual road bridge by a fence and a gate. Walk to the end of the trees.  Climb over the fence in the corner where a piece of 6 x 2 timber has been attached to the fence.  The track disappears steeply downhill under the flax bushes. This track is probably the most dangerous part of the trip. There are numerous stories of people slipping, letting go of their boats and watching them careen down the track and out into the river - to be found later in the day. At least you"

You can leave a car at the Te Tui farm entrance (E2719770 N6177085) or do a longer trip right down to Collier's Bridge. Allow 2-3 hours to Te Tui farm take-out and expect an hour of uphill boat carry.</p><p>The river is continuous Class III at most levels with 2 new rapids that should be scouted. These have formed since the recent lahar came through. The first is a river-wide feature which has a sticky hole on river right at higher flows (boof on river left) E2717940 N6181580). This is about 1/3 of the way down. Later on 2/3 of the way down and after a right hand bend is a very steep drop with a rocky outflow which will cause damage to anyone upside down etc. Scout this from river right and/or run a less spectacular line on hard left (E2718730 N6179420).</p><p>Make a point of bringing your own drinking water as the W originates from the Crater lake on Ruapehu and is naturally acidic as well as passing by the Karioi pulp mill. Enough said.</p><p>The Whangaehu is great for new Class III paddlers with lots of rapids but nothing too intimidating apart from the 2 rapids mentioned above. In November 2007 there were a number of trees and logs in the river - probably left over from the lahar.</p><p>If you are fit and have plenty of time it is best to run the Whangaehu from the Quarry right down to Collier's Bridge rather than taking out at Te Tui. This will avoid the big slog out at Te Tui.

The second is one of the most spectacular on the Coast and makes the trip worthwhile on its own. Low flows (40 - 70 cumecs) are the best time to be in there as intermediate paddlers and your day will be more enjoyable the less water you have. At higher flows (>90 cumecs) expect some pushy class IV/+ water and less relaxation. </p><p>The first major rapid (which is the technical crux) is often portaged on the left side (there is a trail the rafters use). The second crux is in the last gorge. At higher flows there is a great auto boof on the right. At lower flows the hole on the left side is quite trashy. The portage on the right can be a bit of adventure and is a good introduction to West Coast adventure boating. A rope is a good thing to have.</p><p>To get to the take out: find the Whataroa River bridge on SH6, turn eastwards on the gravel road on the southern side for 2km to the old bridge site. There is a large parking area, and camping is allowed. Make sure you have a ready stock of insect repellent because the sandflies are rather aggressive.</p><p>"
